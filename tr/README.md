## Welcome

> Website for Volentix.

This repository will house the artifacts for our public website. 

## Overview

This project houses the html, css, and javascript files for the website.

This project uses:

  * the static website generator [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).
  * [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for the llok and feel.
  * For i18n we are using [Jekyll Polyglot](https://github.com/untra/polyglot)

## Usage

```
Note that the master branch is used to house the generated artifacts. Although Github does support Jekyll, it does not support jekyll-polyglot at this time. As a result, the jekyll project will be housed in the development branch.
```

In order to develop this project locally, you will need to make sure you have the following:
  * ruby version 2.1 or greater
  * gem 2.0 or greater

Once ruby and gem have been installed and configured, you will need to install Jekyll:

Switch to the develop branch:

```
git checkout development
```

Install Bundler and Jekyll.

```
gem install jekyll bundler
```

Run (one time):
```
bundle install
```

To build:
```
jekyll build
```

To serve:
```
jekyll serve
```

Open a web browser to: http://localhost:4000

```
Additionally, you will need to, when changing the i18n artifacts, to stop Jekyll, build, and serve again to see your changes.
```

Happy coding!
